# CodeQL Runner for CircleCI

This builds a container for running CodeQL on circleCI. This is heavily based on the github
codeql-action.

We will try our best to keep up to the changes they are making.

## Usage

This wrapper is best used with the [swissknife orb](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/roopakv/swissknife). More documentation is being added [here](https://docs.swissknife.dev).

The specific CircleCI job that runs CodeQL against your codebase is [here](https://circleci.com/orbs/registry/orb/roopakv/swissknife#jobs-codeql-analysis)
