# CodeQL Runner for CircleCI

This builds a container for running CodeQL on circleCI. This is heavily based on the github
codeql-action.

We will try our best to keep up to the changes they are making, if you have any suggestions or
feature adds, please open an issue and you are encouraged to follow up with a PR after discussion.

This wrapper is best used with the swissknife orb.
